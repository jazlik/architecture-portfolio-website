                        <p class="project-text">The coronavirus pandemic changed the world we live in. We started fearing human contact, closed rooms, public transport, clusters of people...
                            Nearly half a million people who commuted to work in Warsaw every day, were forced to stay at home, did not buy their morning coffee, lunch or meet with their friends for more than three months.
                            Big-city habits, which drive the market, faded away and turned the economy upside down. This economic crisis is particularly dangerous for small and medium sized businesses in Warsaw, like cafes,
                            restaurants or cultural centres, for which loss of accounting liquidity can mean eviction or insolvency. That is why The Stall proposes to reactivate those services and enable further activity while maintaining safety.

                            <p class="project-text"> The most significant guidelines that are being represented by the project is to create a space where people can meet in safety conditions and share their goods and stories. Pavilions can be distributed across
                                the city, thus creating a network of locally available services, limiting the spread of the virus and preventing excessive gatherings of people. Additionally, project assumes low construction and operating costs to make it more affordable for the local communities.

                            <p class="project-text">The design proposal is a temporary modular pavillion, adapted to contemporary challenges: it is a business premise with back shop facilities and a window for serving food or products.
                                Pavillion modules are easily assembles and can be combined with each other, creating unique configurations which can be customized according to its location, fitting the needs of the local community or space requirements.

                                The pavillion offers an independent upper room dedicated to local residents, which can be a space for co-working, individual meetings or a small reading room. Chimney together with large windows are implemented to ventilate
                                the room more efficiently, as the air is circulating through the whole building. Spacious terraces are implemented to help keeping the social distance without giving up social life.

                                The structure of the pavilion is built with a prefabricated wooden skeleton and filled with compressed straw. These materials are environmentally friendly and easily obtained from local sources, also from spillover manufacturing
                                processes which can decrease production costs of the pavilion. Module's facades are protected by a glass cover, which reveals the beauty of the thatch structure and gives it a modern character. On the steepest part of the roof, solar panels are placed
                                to ensure energy independence of the building. When the pandemic stops, pavilions can be given a new function, for example they can become an urban furniture, playground or a local cultural center.
