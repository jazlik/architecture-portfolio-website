                        <p class="project-text">The project presents the concept of Modular Valley, a group of buildings on the northern side of Jerozolimskie Avenue in the city of Warsaw. The project is the
                            result of experimental design process and was carried out using the generative design method. Problems project is answering concern the shortage of attractive space which can encourage people
                            to delve into the urban tissue of the centre of Warsaw, situated on the northern side of the Jerozolimskie Avenue and additionally, lack of correspondence of north and south side of the avenue.

                            <p class="project-text">Project is located at the intersection of Jerozolimskie Avenue and Żelazna street in the city centre of Warsaw, just five minutess walk from the main railway
                                station of Warsaw. As seen on the schwarzplan, Modular Valley is one of the seven projects which are corresponding to each other and together resolving the problems of the northern part of Jerozolimskie Avenue.
                                Northern part of the avenue is better exposed to sunlight than the southern side, however, the space on the northern part is undeveloped and chaotic. It is then not attractive for pedestrians or any passer-by to
                                get involved with that space and there is not purpose using that side of the avenue, as all the services are located on the southern - shaded part of the avenue.

                            <p class="project-text"> One of the main design assumptions is starting by the module, which is treated as the component of all solids. For this reason, building shapes are created from predefined units.

                            <p class="project-text"> There are three types of units that are taking part in the experimental design process. The smallest stackable unit, which means that units can be placed on top of each other, with residential function,
                                midmost residential and office/service stackable unit which can serve both functions and the largest unit which is not stackable, but also with residential and office/service function. These units have their unique function and different
                                size which is corresponding to the given requirements. Nevertheless, the most significant premise is that, units can be arranged differently as the architect designs in order to give the best possible result.

                            <p class="project-text"> The buildings was generated due to the four parameters which are shaping their masses. They concern such characteristics as maximal height of the building,
                                maximal height of the building's arcade, maximal number of modules in the building and maximal width of the building's roof.

                            <p class="project-text"> There are three urban parameters that are shaping the project. Number one - main urban axis that is prolonged through the project's plot. Number two - interposition of the
                                project's buildings to match the development line of the buildings on the other side of Jerozolimskie Avenue. Number three - pedestrian path on Jerozolimskie Avenue that jagged shape inflicts
                                diversity during the walk by the southern facade of the building.

                            <p class="project-text"> The percentile distribution of the glass on the facade is assumed due to sun exposure of the modules. The higher to the top, the bigger need of light and privacy is required from the module.
                                In that way, most residentials are on top, offices in the middle and services on the bottom.

                            <p class="project-text"> The number of moduels stacked on each other is determined due to the insolation in a particular place. As the general rule, the building was cut in a way to deliver as much sun as
                                possible to the axis between the building's volume, creating an artificial valley.
