                    <p class="project-text">The project presents the concept of an office building, adapted
                        to the needs of the IT company dealing with data management. The design’s aim is primarily
                        to answer the lack of inviting and functional office area in the neighborhood of the market
                        square in the city of Katowice and offer an attractive space for inhabitants of the city centre.</p>

                        <p class="project-text">The building is located in the exact city centre of Katowice, near the market square. What was significant during the design process,
                            was the fact that the building’s plot is surrounded from the north and the west side with street and pedestrian passage and from the south
                            and the east side with old tenement buildings. These conditions caused the arrangement of the functions inside the building, setting the
                            office and services on the north-west side, while the creative and entertainment area on the south side. Additionally, curvy edge of the building’s
                            form comes straight from the existing urban communication routes surrounding the office.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p class="project-text">The solid of the building was created with three main assumptions. Firstly, as the building is facing pedestrian area from the north and
                            the west, its north-west corner was rounded to create inviting and streamlined shape for all passersby. Then, the south side of the building was formed into a stepwise
                            terraces to let as much sunlight as possible into the building. Lastly, a glass sun-well was incorporated into the building’s mass in order to provide sunlight
                            for lower floors which are covered by old tenement houses from the south-east.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p class="project-text">The elevation of the building is designed in a way that covers the project’s interior area, due to the profile of the IT company that manages
                            private digital data of its customers. However, the angle at which the elevation panels are installed and their transparental material, enable the sunlight
                            to infiltrate the building's interior while at the same time block the undesired view from the street.</p>
